    <p>>>The government has decided to take strict action against illegal land grabbing and fraudulent property transfers in Islamabad. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has formed a Joint Enquiry Committee (JEC) to probe the alleged scam and fix responsibility on those involved.
</p>

   <p>>>According to a notification issued by the Prime Ministerâ€™s Office, the JEC will thoroughly investigate fraudulent land transfers in the Islamabad Capital Territory and recommend remedial measures to safeguard the rights of victims. The committee has been directed to submit its report within seven days.</p>


   <p>>>The JEC will be headed by the Deputy Commissioner of Islamabad, with representatives from the ISI, IB, FIA, ICT Police, and Pakistan Navy as members. It may also co-opt forensic experts or other specialists as needed.

</p>




<p>>>The Interior Division will formally notify the committee, while the Deputy Commissionerâ€™s office will provide secretarial support. The findings are expected to determine accountability and guide legal action against those responsible.</p>


<p>>>The move follows complaints over the growing influence of land mafias in Islamabad, with victims directly approaching the Prime Minister for redress. The government has sent a clear signal that land grabbing and fraudulent transfers will not be tolerated.</p>
